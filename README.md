# nprConsecutiveSuffixWordsPuzzler
In response to the NPR puzzler on Dec 20, 2015.

## Original Problem
Think of four common six-letter words that all end in the same five letters, in the same order. And the first letters of these four words are consecutive consonants in the alphabet (like B, C, D, F). No other common six-letter words end with these five letters. What are the words?

## Extension
I extended the program to check for varying lengths of words, and varying lengths of consecutive letter sequences. It's currently configured to compute the most reasonable ranges of words.
